      <p>Welcome to this interactive story, where you will find yourself</p>
      <p>
        <strong>"Cheese"</strong> is a metaphor for what we want to have in
        life, whether it is a job, a relationship, money, a big house, freedom,
        health, recognition, spiritual peace, or even an activity like jogging
        or basketball.<br />
        Each of us has his own idea of what Cheese is, and we pursue it because
        we believe it makes us happy. If we get it, we often become attached to
        it. and if we lose it, or it's taken away it can be traumatic.

        Every morning Jaafar dressed in his running gear and headed over to
        Cheese station C where he founds his own kind of cheese. It was a large
        store of cheese that eventually Jaafar moved his house to be closer to
        it and build a social life around it.
        <br /><strong>"Having cheese makes you happy!"</strong><br />
        One morning Jaafar arrived at Cheese Station C and discovered that there
        was no cheese.
