                    <h2>Food Security</h2>
                    <p>
                        is defined as “A situation that exists when all people, at all times, have physical, social and economic access to sufficient, safe and nutritious food that meets their dietary needs and food preferences for an active and healthy life”.
                        Food security does NOT just mean having access to food, but also being able to consume and utilize it in a way that ensures mental and physical health. Without good nutrition people cannot realize their potential and make a contribution to society.
                        In addition to <em>rescuing</em> people from going <em>hungry</em>, <strong>Socialirty</strong> rescues fruits and veggies from going to waste! <em>HOW?</em> By <strong>partnering</strong> with local food retailers on <strong>donating</strong> their surplus produce to our food truck instead.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Food insecurity</h3>
                        <p>
                            is part of a continuum that includes <em>hunger</em> (food deprivation), <em>malnutrition</em> (deficiencies, imbalances, or excesses of nutrients), and <strong>famine</strong>. Long-term lack of food security eventually becomes hunger, defined by the USDA as “an individual-level physiological condition that may result from food insecurity.” On a population level, extreme lack of food security becomes famine.
                        </p>
                    <h3>Food self-sufficiency</h3>
                        <p>
                        defined as the proportion of consumer demand that is met by local production expressed in dietary energy supply (kcal). In Lebanon, it  has remained stable since the 1990’s at approximately 55% due to an improvement in food security, food availability and autonomy in food production, especially since the end of war.
                        But, the 2015 Food Security and Livelihoods Assessment revealed that more than <strong>11 percent</strong> of the Lebanese households were vulnerable to food insecurity. 
                    </p>
                    <h3>Food aid</h3>
                    <p>
                        Many assistance programmes were conducted in Lebanon to ensure food security, especially during the civil conflict period (1975-1990). Un till now, International organization like the FAO work on targeting vulnerable households heavily affected by the multiple <strong>crisis</strong> that Lebanon is facing. 
                        It will contribute to increasing resilience and improving livelihoods of small-scale inductry farming through the support of small poultry and dairy production units in the rural area. Moreover, FAO will support the development of agricaltural infrastructure.
                        FAO will seek to improve the nutrition of vulnerable communities through the promotion of garden walls and school gardens.

                        Synergies will be sought with Ministry of Agricalture, the World Food Program (WFP) and civil society organizations.
                        In additionm FAO will ensure an increased role for rural women whose contribution in agriculture is still underestimated through a number of gender-focused activities including support of micro-entreprises in dairy products and food processing as well as in non-wood forest products (including production and processing of medicinal and aromatic plants) through women cooperatives.
                    </p>
                    <h3>One of multiple causes</h3>
                    <p>
                        About one third of the world’s food produced for human consumption – approximately 1.3b tonnes worth almost $1 trillion – is lost or wasted every year, according to the UN’s Food and Agricultural agency (FAO). In the MENA region, food waste is one of the most prominent waste streams, especially in the GCC region. But in recent years, worldwide, there have been growing movements to save edible products from going to waste and redistribute them to people in need.
                        In Lebanon, nearly 30 percent of all edible food in the Lebanon is wasted (65% of that organic like fruits and veggies) while 29% of the Lebanese population living under the poverty line, add to that the 1.6 million Syrian refugees who also the majority of which is not able to make enough money to make ends meet.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <em>Did you know that 16.5% of children under 5 years old in Lebanon are stunted, meaning they are not developing properly due to malnutrition?<br> …that about 11% of Lebanese, 93% of Syrian refugees, 62% of Palestine refugees in Lebanon, and 94% of Palestine refugees from Syria cannot meet their basic food needs?</em>
                    </p>
                    <h2>Our role</h2>
                    <p>
                        With the help of our <strong>volunteers</strong>, <strong>Socialarity</strong> intercepts unwanted food from various <em>partners</em>, including supermarkets farms, food retailers, restaurants, catering agencies and even rubbish bins and transforms it into wholesome free meals for those in need. In most cases, the recovered food is perfectly edible, but not sellable donated by supermarkets, restaurants, produce markets, dining facilities and sometimes farms. In most cases, the rescued food is being saved from the dumpster and, ultimately, the landfill.
                    </p>
                    <h3>What we can achieve?</h3>
                    <p>
                        Achieving food security is a serious challenge for the countries of the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region, including Lebanon. Lebanon is a small country of 10,452 square kilometers and approximately 4.5 million people subject to heightened demographic pressures, possessing limited arabe land (20% of all land as of 2012, according to the World Bank (2014)) and renewable fresh water (approximately 1,000 m3 per capita, compared to a global average of 6,000 m3), and highly reliant on food imports (for example, roughly 90% of all cereals are imported). 
                        Climate change is contributing to irregular weather patterns, notably serious drought in the 2013- 2014 hydrologic year that saw rainfall at only a fraction of its historic levels. Beyond food availability, food access remains problematic: Many individuals cannot access food in the face of poverty (approximately 28% of the population lives under $4.00 per day according to UNDP figures (2012)), unemployment (approximately 10% according to the Government of Lebanon (2014)) or exclusion from the formal workforce, and a lack of social safety nets.

                        While most Lebanese have access to improved water and sanitation systems, vulnerable demographic groups including refugees remain especially underserved, undermining their ability to utilize food properly. Lebanon is also experiencing a nutrition transition that has contributed to a double-burden of malnutrition, or the presence of under-nutrition and micronutrient deficiency at the same time as overweight and obesity: As the population increasingly shifts from traditional diets heavy in legumes and vegetables towards Western-style diets marked by higher fat, salt, and sugar consumption in the form of processed and fast foods, the prevalence of obesity among Lebanese adults increased from 17% to 28% from 1997 to 2009. Food security in the country is a major concern of the Government of Lebanon, but efforts to tackle it are made mainly by <strong>social initiatives</strong> that try to make difference in this community.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Socialarity is one of those social initiatives</h3>
                    <p>
                        Socialarity provides individuals and companies a realistic chance to develop their community by unleash their inner super heroes <em>Individual Responsibility</em> (IR) and <em>Corporate Social Responsibility</em> (CSR). We do this through building long term partnerships between <strong>Food Donors</strong> and <strong>Food Donees</strong>, organizing <strong>awareness</strong> campaigns and supporting policy processes.
